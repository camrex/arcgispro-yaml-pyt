  summary: |
    A professional toolbox for spatial analysis operations including buffer creation,
    feature clipping, and proximity analysis.
  description: |
    This toolbox provides essential spatial analysis tools designed for daily
    GIS workflows. All tools support large datasets and include progress indicators
    for long-running operations.
    
    Key Features:
    - Buffer analysis with multiple distance options
    - Feature clipping with topology preservation
    - Batch processing support
    - Detailed error messages and validation
    
    All tools have been tested with ArcGIS Pro 3.x and support both feature
    classes and shapefiles as input.
