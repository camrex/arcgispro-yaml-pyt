  summary: |
    A proof-of-concept ArcGIS Pro Python Toolbox demonstrating configuration-driven 
    tool development using YAML files. Eliminates boilerplate code through dynamic 
    tool generation.
  description: |
    This toolbox provides a modern approach to ArcGIS Pro Python Toolbox development 
    by using YAML configuration files to define tools instead of writing repetitive 
    wrapper classes. Tools are dynamically generated at runtime, allowing developers 
    to focus on business logic while the framework handles parameter management, 
    validation, and ArcGIS Pro integration.
    
    Features:
    - Zero boilerplate - Define tools in YAML, write only business logic
    - Automatic parameter management with type validation
    - Runtime validation rules defined in configuration
    - Comprehensive metadata documentation support
    - Self-documenting through YAML configuration
    - Easy to test with mocked arcpy
  tags:
    - yaml
    - configuration
    - geoprocessing
