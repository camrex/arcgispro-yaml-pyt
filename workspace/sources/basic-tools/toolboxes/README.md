# Toolboxes Directory

This directory contains **Python Toolbox (`.pyt`) definitions** organized by domain/purpose.

## Structure

Each toolbox folder contains:
- `<name>.pyt` - The Python Toolbox file (opened in ArcGIS Pro)
- `toolbox.yml` - Configuration defining which tools to include
- `*.pyt.xml` - Metadata files (auto-generated by ArcGIS Pro)

## Multiple Toolboxes

This demonstrates the framework's support for **multiple toolboxes** with different tool selections:

### `spatial_analysis/`
Spatial analysis tools for geographic operations:
- Buffer Analysis
- Clip Features

### `utilities/`
Utility tools for toolbox management:
- Load Tool Metadata

## Many-to-Many Relationship

The same tool can appear in multiple toolboxes by simply referencing it in each `toolbox.yml`. Tools are implemented once in `src/tools/` and reused across toolboxes.

## Usage

In ArcGIS Pro:
1. Open Catalog pane
2. Add Toolbox → Browse to either:
   - `spatial_analysis/spatial_analysis.pyt`
   - `utilities/utilities.pyt`
3. Each toolbox shows only its configured tools

## For Add-in Mode

In the future Add-in architecture:
- Users can create custom toolboxes via the Add-in UI
- Select tools from the catalog
- Generate `.pyt` and `toolbox.yml` automatically
- Tools remain in the shared catalog, toolboxes just reference them
