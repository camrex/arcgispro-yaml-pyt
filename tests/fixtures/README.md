# Test Fixtures

This directory contains minimal YAML files for testing purposes.

These are NOT meant to be full-featured examples - for that, see `../examples/`.

Fixtures here are intentionally simple and focused on testing specific scenarios:
- Valid configurations
- Invalid configurations (for error testing)
- Edge cases
- Minimal required fields
